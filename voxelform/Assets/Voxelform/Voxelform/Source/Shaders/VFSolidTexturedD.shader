 *  
 *  This shader provides psuedo-volumetric texturing, using a 2D texture as a source.
 *  Please experiment with different source textures.  The 3D texturing will look different
 *  than the 2D source, but some elements will still be seen.  Results will vary due to
 *  the number of cycles and unique features of the 2D source.
 *
 *  Note: Fixed mip-mapping "black mirage" issue in v1.1
 *  
 *  I highly recommend experimenting with some of the textures from this site:
 *  http://www.filterforge.com/filters/category46-page1.html
